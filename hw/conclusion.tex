\section{Conclusion}

In this homework, we explored various concepts of linear algebra, including vector spaces, linear transformations, and eigenvalues. We demonstrated the application of these concepts through examples and problem-solving techniques. The understanding of these topics is crucial for further studies in mathematics and its applications in various fields such as engineering, physics, and computer science.

We hope that this work has provided a solid foundation in linear algebra and has encouraged further exploration of the subject.
